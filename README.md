# Wiktex Project

A subset of LaTeX commands can be used, in addition to new commands for inserting third-party multimedia content (GeoGebra and YouTube) and specific commands for HTML formatting. So far, page editing, version control and media management are implemented. A license control system has not yet been implemented, so you need to edit the login informations manually, as well as some site configurations.

Ace (https://ace.c9.io/) is used for LaTeX code edition.

Wiktex doesn't use a database, everything is done with file management, as in other wiki projects. All you need is ~~love~~ a php environment with write permission to files.

This is a very early version of the project. If you want to use it and/or contribute, let me know (this will save you a lot of time!).

# About me

My name is Leonardo Silvares and I'm professor of Mathematics at Universidade Federal Fluminense, in Niter√≥i, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In addition to teaching, I have some strange form of fun working in math related programming projects, like WikTex and 3Graf (www.3graf.com). My endorphin shots comes from street running (half marathon).

You can contact me at leotadeu@gmail.com .
